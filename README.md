 The discovery of One algorithm used in WPSPIN have been made parallely and previously by zhaochunsheng in a C. script named computepinC83A35. as i don't known C or
 programming and found this out after coding the first version of WPS, this bash script doesn't use a dingle line of computepinC83A35.
 But it had to be saved that zhaochunsheng found the main algorithm on Chinese access points months before I found it on a new Belkin N router, without knowing it works.
 The page of the author is sadly down and i cannot link you to a straight source
